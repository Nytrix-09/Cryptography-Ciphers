# Cryptography-Ciphers

This is a repository that contains all the ciphers that I've come across as a student studying *cryptography methods and techniques utilizing various ciphers*; and the implementation of the cipher techniques in **python** . 

All implementations have the option to either encrypt/decrypt text, as the user desries. 

  Any and all suggestions towards the improvement of the space/time complexity of the codes are greatly appreciated.


#### The following ciphers are implemented in this repository:
1. Caesar Cipher
2. Rail Fence Cipher
3. Atbash Cipher
4. Keyword Cipher
5. Mix Cipher
